# Next Sequence Prediction Repository

Welcome to the Sequence Prediction Repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various methods and techniques for sequence prediction. 

## Methods
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Markov Chain
- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- And more...

Each method has its own directory within this repository, containing code examples, tutorials, and documentation.

## Datasets
LSTM-Word-Prediction.ipynb: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorianlazar/medium-articles-dataset  <br>
Time-Series-Forecasting.ipynb: https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/airline-passengers.csv 
## Future Updates

I am just getting started with this repository, and I plan to continue adding more methods, datasets, and resources.
